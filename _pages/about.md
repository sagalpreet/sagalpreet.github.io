I am a **[CS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)** enthusiast applying my knowledge to build novel and scalable Speech AI services on cloud at Oracle. My love for mathematics drives me crazy about solving **puzzles and problems** and I take keen interest in research and innovation.

Solving problems from **first principles** gives me a lot of satisfaction and solving problems through intuition and tricks makes me wonder about **nature** and **human brain**.

Having explored a lot of fields in **mathematics** and **computer science**, I have found my deepest interest in **Core CS, AI, probability and statistics**.

My secondary interests include the study of **financial world, startups, philosophy, and politics**. You might find me playing **cricket** üèè sometimes.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
