I'm a **[CS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)** enthusiast, diving into **research** to tackle open problems and unravel new possibilities. My love for **math** fuels my passion for solving puzzles and tackling challenges from **first principles**—it’s deeply satisfying. I’m fascinated by how **intuition** and **clever tricks** reveal insights into nature and the human mind.

With a solid foundation in mathematics and CS, my heart lies in **AI**, **probability**, and **statistics**. I have worked on **machine learning** problems which have led to publications at top tier conferences. I have previously worked on **multi-agent** frameworks, **autoregressive** and **diffusion** based **speech** and **audio** models, **domain adaptation** and **learning from labeled proportions**.

Outside of study, you'll catch me at the **gym** 👟, on the **cricket** field 🏏, or **coding apps** to make life a bit simpler! I also like to keep myself informed and engaged in **finance**, **startups**, **music**, and **politics**.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
