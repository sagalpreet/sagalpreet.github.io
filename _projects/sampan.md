These apps aim to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anganwadi">Anganwadi</a> users, Child Development Project Officers and other field level implementers to record, calculate, analyse and/or organize data related to children malnourishment and Body Mass Index. This work is also part of Government initiatives in relation to "Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana".

<i>
The apps are currently being used by all the Anganwadis of Rupnagar district and everyday 1000s of entries are logged.
The apps are supported for a wide range of android versions.

    The apps are created keeping in mind the less educated and less tech-savvy users who appreciate simple interface. The lite version doesn't support cloud sync for data and the data is locally stored. The apps provide data sharing and importing capabilities.
